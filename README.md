# intro-to-javascript

## Let's learn a bit about JavaScript, a programming language for the web! You can use JavaScript to make your webpages more interactive and complex. This repo will give you a starting point so you only have to worry about manipulating JavaScript code, and not setting up a webpage.

## Your task is to add the missing functionality to this simple calculator, then try to complete one or more of the challenges provided. It's ok if you don't know what to do - feel free to ask for help, and I also encourage you to use the internet to try to find solutions to specific problems you're facing (part of being a good programmer is being good at seeking and understanding help!)
